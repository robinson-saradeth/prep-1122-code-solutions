  <h1>I would like to build</h1>
  <p>
    With my new coding skills, I would like to build amazing applications that we use in our daily lives, various ones that business uses, and even healthcare
    facilities. From web pages, to programs, and even apps on our phones. I know this may require the building blocks of
    html, css, and javascript. Afterwards more advanced languages like react may me implemented.
